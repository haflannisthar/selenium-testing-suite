# Header Selenium Testing Practice
A project demonstrating comprehensive Selenium testing skills through practical examples on websites like DemoQA. This repository contains automated test scripts covering essential aspects of web application testing, including functional testing, UI testing, and form validation.

## Header About the Project
This project was created as a self-directed learning initiative to gain hands-on experience in automated web testing using Selenium. The tests cover various scenarios to mimic real-world testing workflows, focusing on enhancing software quality through automation.

## Header Key Focus Areas
* Functional Testing: Validates core functionalities of the website, including button clicks, form submissions, and navigation.
* UI Testing: Ensures the appearance of elements meets design expectations, especially for visible elements, layout consistency, and responsiveness.
* Form Validation: Tests different form elements and validations, such as mandatory fields, error messages, and field constraints.
* Automation of Repetitive Test Cases: Reduces manual effort by automating repetitive tasks, like login/logout, data input, and UI checks.

## Header Technologies Used
* Selenium WebDriver: Used for automating browser actions and interactions.
* Java: The primary language for writing and organizing test scripts.
* TestNG: Used as the test framework for managing test cases, grouping tests, and generating reports.
* DemoQA & Other Sites: Public sites used as the testing platform for diverse web elements and interaction testing.
